## Apple watch OS Management

#### `Mohammed Ali Mohammed Al Sakkaf`

### Project Description
Apple Watch running watchOS 10 or later is paired with an iPhone running iOS 17 or later, the watch can be enrolled into and managed by mobile device management (MDM). In this way, the watch supports use cases that not only improve the user’s productivity, but also support their wellness and offer them extra safety benefits.
- Enable MDM management
- Install, remove and update Apple Watch apps using MDM commands
- Configure settings, retrieve device information, clear the passcode, lock or erase the Apple Watch.
- Unenroll Apple Watch from MDM
- DDM support.

### Justifications
 This project is crucial for supporting OS management on the Apple platform, specifically for Apple Watch. It presents an excellent opportunity for interns, offering a comprehensive learning experience. Interns will engage in reading and understanding Apple documentation, designing a solution, and both developing and documenting their work. Notably, this project can be accomplished without current MDM support by using Apple Configurator.

### Scope:
1. Understand how apple devices are managed currently. 
2. Understand various paradigms of management of Apple Watch introduced by Apple.
3. Understand, design and POC how an apple watch can be enrolled in Maas360. 
4. Review and recommend what use cases and policies are most relevant  to be implemented for apple watch managemet. (Market Study and other things)
5. Understand, design and POC how policies/configurations can be applied an apple watch 
6. Understand, desisgn and POC of how apps can be distributed to apple watch 

### Comment
- Must cover use cases for DLP/Data protection/Restrictions use cases in both paired mode and independent modes of operation.
